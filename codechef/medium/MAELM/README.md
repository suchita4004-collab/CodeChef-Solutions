## Problem

### Matrix Element Match

You are given an $N \times N$ matrix $A$ and an $M \times M$ matrix $B$.

Matrix $B$ is considered present in $A$ if every element of $B$ can be matched with an equal element in $A$,  **regardless of its position**.

Each occurrence in $A$ can be used only once. Therefore, if a value appears multiple times in $B$, it must appear at least the same number of times in $A$.

For example, if `5` appears twice in $B$, then $A$ must also contain at least two occurrences of `5`.

Determine whether all elements of $B$ can be matched in $A$.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $N$ — the size of matrix $A$.
- The second line contains an integer $M$ — the size of matrix $B$.
- Each of the next $N$ lines contains $N$ space-separated integers representing matrix $A$.
- Each of the next $M$ lines contains $M$ space-separated integers representing matrix $B$.
### Output Format

Print `TRUE` if every element of $B$ can be matched with an equal element in $A$, using each occurrence in $A$ at most once.

Otherwise, print `FALSE`.

### Constraints
- $1 \le M \le N \le 500$
- $-10^9 \le A_{i,j}, B_{i,j} \le 10^9$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
2
1 7 2
8 3 6
9 5 3
1 2
3 3
```

```
TRUE
```

### Explanation:

Matrix $B$ contains `1`, `2`, `3`, and `3`.

Each of these values is present in matrix $A$, so the answer is `TRUE`.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
3
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
1 2 2
4 5 5
7 8 8
```

```
FALSE
```

### Explanation:

Matrix $B$ requires two occurrences each of `2`, `5`, and `8`.

Matrix $A$ contains only one occurrence of each of these values.

Therefore, all elements of $B$ cannot be matched, and the answer is `FALSE`.

```py
# cook your dish here
N = int(input())
M = int(input())

count_A = {}

for _ in range(N):
    row = map(int, input().split())
    for x in row:
        count_A[x] = count_A.get(x, 0) + 1

count_B = {}

for _ in range(M):
    row = map(int, input().split())
    for x in row:
        count_B[x] = count_B.get(x, 0) + 1

answer = True

for x in count_B:
    if count_A.get(x, 0) < count_B[x]:
        answer = False
        break

if answer:
    print("TRUE")
else:
    print("FALSE")
```
