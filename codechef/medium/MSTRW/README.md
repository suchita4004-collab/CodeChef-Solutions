## Problem

### Minimum String Weight

Chef is preparing a string $S$ for storage. Its  **weight**  is the sum of the squares of the frequencies of its distinct characters.

For example, the weight of aab is $2^2+1^2=5$.

Chef must remove  **exactly $K$ characters**  from $S$. The removed characters may come from any positions. Find the  **minimum possible weight**  of the remaining string.

An empty string has weight $0$.

### Input Format
- The first line contains the string $S$. This line may be empty.
- The second line contains an integer $K$, the number of characters to remove.
### Output Format

Print a single integer — the minimum possible weight after exactly $K$ removals.

### Constraints
- $0 \le K \le 5\times10^4$
- $1 \le |S| \le 5\times10^4$
- $K \le |S|$
- Every character of $S$ is a lowercase English letter.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
abccc
1
```

```
6
```

### Explanation:

Remove one occurrence of c. The remaining frequencies are $1$, $1$, and $2$, giving weight $1^2+1^2+2^2=6$.

Removing a or b instead would leave weight $10$, so $6$ is the minimum.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
aabcbcbcabcc
3
```

```
27
```

### Explanation:

The frequencies of a, b, and c are $3$, $4$, and $5$. Remove one b and two copies of c to leave frequency $3$ for every character.

The weight is $3^2+3^2+3^2=27$. This equal distribution minimizes the weight of the nine remaining characters.

```py
# cook your dish here
S = input().strip()
K = int(input())

freq = [0] * 26

for ch in S:
    freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1

for _ in range(K):
    max_index = 0

    for i in range(26):
        if freq[i] > freq[max_index]:
            max_index = i

    if freq[max_index] == 0:
        break

    freq[max_index] -= 1

answer = 0

for f in freq:
    answer += f * f

print(answer)
```
