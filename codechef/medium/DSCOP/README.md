## Problem

### Discount

You are buying an item that costs $N$ rupees.

The shopkeeper gives you a special discount: you may remove  **exactly one digit**  from the decimal representation of $N$. The remaining digits, in the same order, form the new price you have to pay.

Your task is to find the  **minimum possible price**  after removing exactly one digit.

The resulting number may contain leading zeros. However, while printing the answer, leading zeros must not be printed.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases.
- Each of the next $T$ lines contains a single integer $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print the minimum price that can be obtained after removing exactly one digit from $N$.

Print each answer on a separate line.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $10 \le N \le 10^9$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
57
908
1005
4321
```

```
5
8
5
321
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:** 

For $N = 57$:

- Removing $5$ gives $7$.
- Removing $7$ gives $5$.

Therefore, the minimum possible price is $5$.

 **Test Case 2:** 

For $N = 908$:

- Removing $9$ gives $08$, which is printed as $8$.
- Removing $0$ gives $98$.
- Removing $8$ gives $90$.

Therefore, the minimum possible price is $8$.

 **Test Case 3:** 

For $N = 1005$, removing the first digit gives $005$, which is printed as $5$.

Therefore, the minimum possible price is $5$.

 **Test Case 4:** 

For $N = 4321$, the possible prices are $321$, $421$, $431$, and $432$.

Therefore, the minimum possible price is $321$.

```py
# cook your dish here
T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):
    N = input().strip()

    for i in range(len(N) - 1):
        if N[i] > N[i + 1]:
            N = N[:i] + N[i + 1:]
            break
    else:
        N = N[:-1]

    print(int(N))
```
